# Markdown Warm Up
[This is the website URL](https://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/sruniverse.html "Webshop for drawing stuff")    
The last update was in january 2019.  
We've googled 'Most Ugly Website' and this was the winner.     
  
we are not really sure what this website does. we think they sell stuff

## What's needed? 
- Better CSS
- Better alligning
- other color palette
- needs better *listing* .  
  
the site is not active on **social media** for as far as we can see, which is rather a good thing  
  
### we spent quite some time understanding Github :P
